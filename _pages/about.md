I'm a Computer Science major at Macalester College with an interest in full-stack development, and UX design. I'm also an undergraduate researcher at Macalester's [CS Department](https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/). Advised by Professors [Abby Marsh](https://www.abbymarsh.com/) and [Suhas Arehalli](https://sarehalli.github.io/), my research sits at the intersection of Computational Social Science, Human-Computer Interaction, and Sociology.

My primary research interest lies in how users choose to interact on social platforms and the factors that shape those decisions. My current undergraduate research centers on this topic by examining how insular, anonymous online communities use language to signal in-group and out-group belonging, maintain ideological cohesion, and cultivate supportive or judgmental environments. As an avid internet user, this work has encouraged a level of self-reflexivity on how the online spaces I frequent work to create belonging for individuals with shared identities and interests. I plan to culminate my research in my Honors thesis.
