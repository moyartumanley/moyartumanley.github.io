I had never traveled outside of the country before, let alone taken a plane by myself (to the point where I, in a panic, messaged my PI asking how baggage claims worked). As the time to leave for Sweden grew closer, I felt like somehow I would somehow miss my flight and my overall semester abroad. But I made it! And I am forever grateful that I did.</p> <p>It’s very cliche, but I feel like I found myself while I was abroad. Prior to study abroad, I would say that I felt a sense of imposter syndrome within my major. There was a feeling that I needed to be doing something important at all times in order to prove that I belonged in my courses and in my research. However, that led to a feeling of burnout and personal disgust when I could no longer do tasks or articulate myself in a manner that I was proud of.</p> <h3 id="lagom-not-too-much-not-too-little">Lagom: “not too much, not too little”</h3> <p>During my time in Sweden, I feel like I was swept into the concept of Lagom, which roughly translates to “just right”. My coursework was incredibly manageable and I was not working on research that semester. So, I had time to discover old and new things that I enjoyed. I went thrift-store hopping near Slussen, found new favorite food spots (<em>Village Bagels and Dubbla Deli, I miss you dearly…</em>), indulged in princess cake from Vette-Katten, did a yoga + ice plunge + sauna trip despite not knowing how to swim, explored the archipelago, Uppsala and so much more.</p> <h3 id="alongside-my-personal-adventures-im-also-grateful-for-the-classes-i-took">Alongside my personal adventures, I’m also grateful for the classes I took.</h3> <h5 id="scandinavian-textiles-and-fashion-workshop">Scandinavian Textiles and Fashion Workshop</h5> <p>As a STEM major, I feel like I don’t often have the opportunity to take art classes, let alone a fashion course. So, I took Scandinavian Textiles and Fashion Workshop and loved that class dearly. I know how to hand-sew (only via back-stitch), so learning about fabrics, draping, crochet, and making personal fashion collections and sketches made me flex my creative muscle. Prior to college, I used to draw as a hobby but as responsibilities increased, that got pushed to the side, so it was so fun to draw again! 2026, I want to try upcycling to hopefully work up to being more confident creating patterns and sewing clothes for myself.</p> <h5 id="gender-sexuality-race-and-equality-in-scandinavia">Gender, Sexuality, Race, and Equality in Scandinavia</h5> <p>I’m also grateful for my core course: Gender, Sexuality, Race, and Equality in Scandinavia. All of our courses had field studies, where we went out into Stockholm and had a field-trip that related to the course. However, a lot of the field studies we had for GSRE were really eye-opening and helped show the concepts we were learning in a real-world context. One field study that really impacted me was a homeless tour we took, where a former homeless person guided us around Stockholm and told us about her experiences in specific spots as a homeless person. I feel that the manners in which homelessness is discussed is very detached from the people affected by it. So, hearing and seeing what our tour guide did to survive hit hard.</p> <p>This class motivated me to at the very least minor in sociology (debating double-majoring). Furthermore, while I knew I wanted to do something related to human-centered computing, taking this course made me realize that HCI goes beyond the end-user but the societal factors that influence who is the user and the ways in which they interact with technology. For instance, when we design software:</p> <ul> <li>Is the idealized end user (or the UX persona) inclusive of all users?</li> <li>Do we prioritize those who are relatively familiar with existing technologies?</li> <li>If so, who does that exclude?</li> <li>Where do those exclusions fall in terms of socioeconomic status?</li> <li>Where do they fall in terms of age?</li> <li>How do these exclusions manifest in terms of the demographics of users? I feel like these are questions that arise now, since taking this course.</li> </ul> <h5 id="artificial-intelligence--data-driven-information-visualization">Artificial Intelligence &amp; Data-Driven Information Visualization</h5> <p>My CS related courses (Artificial Intelligence, Data-Driven Information Visualization) helped me gain confidence in my skills. In AI, I discussed anything with my classmates, and initially I felt unsure in everything I said and added an <em>“but I might be wrong”</em> addendum to everything. But, my homework partner would complement me on my skills, saying that I carried in terms of the homework. When I talked about possible algorithm implementations with a different classmate, it felt like a back and forth discussion that I was actually a part of, rather than a handwave and my suggestions being ignored. Instances like that made me want to cry tears of joy, because they made me feel like I truly belonged in my major. Through those experiences, I feel that I have more confidence to speak up during pair-programming sessions, and I will carry that confidence through the rest of undergrad and beyond.</p> <p>The same can be said for my data visualization course! Although I’m not the biggest fan of JavaScript, I’ve learned many practical skills in terms of building software, and I got to combine my love of public transit with my final project and create a departure tracker for Stockholm’s public transit system. I also learned how to create charts via d3.js and Observable, which will prove useful during my Honors thesis.</p> <h3 id="country-roads-take-me-home-to-the-place-i-belong-berlin">Country roads, take me home to the place, I belong. Berlin.</h3> <p>Finally, through study tours I got to explore more of Europe! During my time abroad, I visited Karlstad, Oslo, Copenhagen and Berlin (<em>My favorite. My LinkedIn header is a picture I took while there.</em>). I loved the ducks of Karlstad, the sailboats of Copenhagen, the seagulls of Oslo, and will always remember the old man who waltzed with me to Country Roads at Murphy’s Irish Pub in Berlin. I love the grit the city has, as well as its artistic freedom (evident by the beautiful graffiti that is embraced by the city). When I was there, I feel like I got to bond with my classmates on a deeper level (<em>from near-death experiences near Berghain to wandering the city</em>), and I still keep in touch with them to this day! I never thought I would be able to travel to so many countries so soon, so I am very thankful to DIS for that!</p> <h3 id="study-abroad">Study abroad!</h3> <p>As a new member of my major’s student advisory board, I think the one thing I want to emphasize and make easier for students is the process of studying abroad. I’ve heard many CS majors say that studying abroad doesn’t fit into their schedule due to the lack of CS classes. However, I feel like that is because a lot of programs that are advertised often are aimed at humanities majors (I found my program entirely by chance).</p> <p>While I do attend a liberal arts college and one can do gen-eds abroad, it is so important for STEM majors, especially CS majors to step outside of the grey concrete building that is Olin-Rice and learn outside of that. Have experiences that decenter you the programmer and make you think more about the people that your work impacts, people within your nation sure, but internationally as well. For instance, doing an AI field study at Tobii Dynavox made me realize that coding isn’t just algorithms or designing front-end platforms but working with researchers and scientists on making accessible interfaces that respond quickly to eye-tracking or touch input for those who are non-verbal or cannot use their hands. These real world experiences shape the way in which you think about the code you write and the software you create.</p> <p>Furthermore, as an FGLI student, the thought of studying abroad intially seemed financially daunting, but through scholarships from my college and my study abroad program, I got to live, eat, and travel essentially for free. So, for CS students or students in general: Study abroad!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal"/><category term="study-abroad"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aug 16th - Dec 12th 2025]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra</title><link href="https://moyartumanley.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra"/><published>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://moyartumanley.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://moyartumanley.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/"><![CDATA[<p>May 14, 2024 We’re introducing a series of updates across the Gemini family of models, including the new 1.5 Flash, our lightweight model for speed and efficiency, and Project Astra, our vision for the future of AI assistants. In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.
