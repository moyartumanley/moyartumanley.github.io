This year, I want to start dipping my toes into actual front-end design, rather than just creating simple HTML pages or Figma prototypes. So, I decided to start with my website!

While my site is based off of a template, I still learned a lot from digging into the SCSS files and trying to make it my own. When I was an underclassmen, I wanted to have separate pages for my UX work, and research/in-class projects, however with this redesign I decided to combine elements of both. The current CSS is definitely different that the one I envisioned for my UX portfoio, but I wanted to maintain a more professional feel, rather than using colors that were on the bolder side. However, I also wanted to maintain that mix of pixel font and sans-serif that I had in my portfolio wireframe. I really love the way the fonts play together, and I feel that it brings a teeny bit of personality that would have been lost by only using sans-serif. 

Everything's still a work-in-progress, but I'm happy where things are at so far!
